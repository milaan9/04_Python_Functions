Analogous to this, Python has packages for directories and **[modules](https://github.com/milaan9/04_Python_Functions/blob/main/007_Python_Function_Module.ipynb)** for files.\n",

    "## Importing module from a package\n",
    "\n",
    "We can import modules from packages using the dot **`.`** operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we want to import the **`start`** module in the above example, it can be done as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>>import Game.Level.start\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if this module contains a **[function](https://github.com/milaan9/04_Python_Functions/blob/main/001_Python_Functions.ipynb)** named **`select_difficulty()`**, we must use the full name to reference it.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>>Game.Level.start.select_difficulty(2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If this construct seems lengthy, we can import the module without the package prefix as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>>from Game.Level import start\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now call the function simply as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>>start.select_difficulty(2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way of importing just the required function (or class or variable) from a module within a package would be as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>>from Game.Level.start import select_difficulty\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can directly call this function.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>>select_difficulty(2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Although easier, this method is not recommended. Using the full **[namespace](https://github.com/milaan9/01_Python_Introduction/blob/main/013_Python_Namespace_and_Scope.ipynb)** avoids confusion and prevents two same identifier names from colliding.\n",
    "\n",
    "While importing packages, Python looks in the list of directories defined in **`sys.path`**, similar as for **[module search path](https://github.com/milaan9/04_Python_Functions/blob/main/007_Python_Function_Module.ipynb)**."
